# Performance Optimization

## Model Selection Strategy

**Haiku 4.5** (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, 3x cost savings):
- Lightweight agents with frequent invocation
- Pair programming and code generation
- Worker agents in multi-agent systems

**Sonnet 4.6** (`claude-sonnet-4-6`, best coding model):
- Main development work
- Orchestrating multi-agent workflows
- Complex coding tasks

**Opus 4.6** (`claude-opus-4-6`, deepest reasoning):
- Complex architectural decisions
- Maximum reasoning requirements
- Research and analysis tasks

## Context Window Management

Avoid last 20% of context window for:
- Large-scale refactoring
- Feature implementation spanning multiple files
- Debugging complex interactions

Lower context sensitivity tasks:
- Single-file edits
- Independent utility creation
- Documentation updates
- Simple bug fixes

## Ultrathink + Plan Mode

For complex tasks requiring deep reasoning:
1. Use `ultrathink` for enhanced thinking
2. Enable **Plan Mode** for structured approach
3. "Rev the engine" with multiple critique rounds
4. Use split role sub-agents for diverse analysis

## Build Troubleshooting

If build fails:
1. Use **build-error-resolver** agent
2. Analyze error messages
3. Fix incrementally
4. Verify after each fix
